E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea
-Location-Based Search: Users can simply enter their current location or enable location services to automatically detect their position. The app then provides a list of nearby e-waste recycling facilities, including recycling centers, drop-off locations, and scheduled collection events.

-Detailed Facility Information: For each listed facility, EcoSpot Locator offers detailed information such as address, contact details, operating hours, accepted items, and any special instructions for dropping off e-waste. This ensures users have all the necessary information to plan their visit.

-Filtering Options: Users can narrow down their search results based on specific criteria such as the types of electronics accepted, facility accessibility (e.g., wheelchair accessibility), and proximity to public transportation. This helps users find the most convenient recycling option for their needs.

-Real-Time Updates: The app regularly updates its database to reflect changes in facility locations, operating hours, and accepted items. Users can trust that the information provided is accurate and up-to-date.

-Notification System: EcoSpot Locator includes a notification system to alert users about important updates related to e-waste recycling, such as changes in facility hours, new recycling initiatives, or upcoming collection events in their area.
